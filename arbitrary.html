			<li>Push the button marked, "Show Image Grid".  It'll do exactly what it says.</li>
			<li>Once you see the grid, you can click and drag all the images around the page pretty much wherever you want.</li>
			<li>Want a better view of one of the images?  That's pretty easy to do, too.  Just double-click it and it'll grow to fill the screen.  When you're done viewing it at high-resolution, just double-click it again and it'll collapse right back down to its original location on the original grid.</li>
			<li>Want to randomize the placement of the pictures on the grid?  That's pretty easy, too.  Just click "Show Image Grid" again, and it'll show a new, randomized grid of pictures.</li>
