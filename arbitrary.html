		<p>Below are the instructions for the current project:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Write some javascript in ./yours.js to stick some draggable image/text/video components in #container as pulled from an external data source of your choice.</li>
			<li>Add a title and some simple formatting to each component as defined *once* in an arbitrary html file in the same directory using a single GET.</li>
			<li>Clicking on one of the components should make it smoothly grow to fill the whole screen avoiding image pixelation.</li>
			<li>Then when you click on it again it should shrink back to the same position it was at before you clicked on it.</li>
			<li>Also add a button to randomly rearrange the components within #container.</li>
		</ul>
